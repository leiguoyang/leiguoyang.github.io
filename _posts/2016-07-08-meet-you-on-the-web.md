Hello, friends, I am guoyang. Nice to meet you here. This is my personal website powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [github](https://github.com).

I think the web is amazing, via which I can share things with you, like my writings, local news, or even I can sell you some of the produce from my family in the future, so great O(∩_∩)O. Each year my parents plant quite a lot of produce, such as 葛，淮山, and my mom would sell some of them on the street market.  

I am still a newbie on the web, hope to be better tomorrow :)
