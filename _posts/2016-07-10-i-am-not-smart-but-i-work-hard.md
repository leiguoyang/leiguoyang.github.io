title: I am not smart but I work hard
date: 2016-07-10

These days I am learning how to make webpages, and programming. The two main problems I encountered are the English languange itself and the technical terms on web develepment. I am not good at English, so it's quite hard for me to fully understand the technical terms. Most of the time, I have to review the concepts for a couple of times before I get it :(

I know I am not smart enough, but I work hard. God rewards those who work hard. Right :)
